Exchange rate projections are provided by country economists for the group of other emerging market and developing countries. Exchanges rates for advanced economies are established in the WEO assumptions for each WEO exercise. Expenditure-based GDP is total final expenditures at purchasers’ prices (including the f.o.b. value of exports of goods and services), less the f.o.b. value of imports of goods and services. \[SNA 1993\]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | U.S. dollars                                   | Billions | See notes for: Gross domestic product, current prices (National currency).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                  2023 | 1980 |     NA |
